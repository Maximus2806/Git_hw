Title: Incorrect Calculation in Total Price on Checkout Page

ID: BR-2024-001

Reporter: Jane Doe

Date: May 18, 2024

Priority: High

Severity: Critical

Status: Open

Environment:

OS: Windows 10 Pro, version 21H2
Browser: Google Chrome, version 90.0.4430.93
Application Version: 3.1.5
Device: Desktop
Description:
When a user proceeds to the checkout page, the total price displayed does not correctly sum up the individual item prices and applied discounts. This leads to an incorrect total price calculation, potentially causing overcharging or undercharging the customer.

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in to the application using valid credentials.
Add the following items to the cart:
Item A: $50
Item B: $30
Item C: $20
Apply a discount code "DISCOUNT10" which gives a 10% discount on the total purchase.
Proceed to the checkout page.
Expected Result:
The total price should be calculated as:

Subtotal: $50 + $30 + $20 = $100
Discount: 10% of $100 = $10
Total: $100 - $10 = $90
Actual Result:
The total price displayed on the checkout page is $95.

Possible Impact:

Users may lose trust in the accuracy of the billing system.
Financial discrepancies affecting company revenue.
Potential legal issues due to incorrect billing.
Suggested Fix:
Review the price calculation logic on the checkout page, particularly the application of discounts and the final total calculation.
